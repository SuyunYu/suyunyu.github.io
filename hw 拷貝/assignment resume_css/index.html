    <h1 class="index-h1" id="maintitle">About Me</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
    I am a Junior major in Art and minor in Advertising. Hongkong is my home town, a beautiful international city located in southern China.

    <p class="paragraph">
       I came to <a href="#">University of Miami</a> in 2015 to study abroad, and it has been three years full of happiness and adventures. The reason why I chose Miami as the place to live and study, are the nice weather and amazing people here.
     </p>

     <p class="paragraph">
       I am outgoing, optimistic, enthusiastic and always curious to the world and to my life. Although I have more talent in art than in science, I am keen on exploring the nature and creatures in the world.
     </p>

     <p class="paragraph">
       My family members live in different countries so I travelled a lot.
